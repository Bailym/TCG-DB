# TCG DB
**Pokemon Trading Card Game Database**

Personal project I started which uses the pokemontgc API to show card lists, details and prices.
I was planning to develop this into a full collection tracker with wishlistsand price tracking etc. but lost interest.

**Key Details**
- React + Node + Express
- Material UI 
- PokemonTCG API

**Features**
- Complete pokemon card database grouped by set.
- Key card details, moves and prices from TCG API

**Possible Future Ideas**
 - Browser cahcing to improve load time and reduce API calls.
 - Mark cards as 'collected'.
 - View your collection
 - Idenitfy a "wishlist' of cards you want to buy/track
 - Price tracking for specific cards
